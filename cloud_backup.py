"""Incremental, verified backup of mappings.db + S.S IMAGE + small JSON
caches to a Google Drive folder, authenticated as a real Google account
via OAuth (installed-app flow) -- not a Service Account. A Service
Account has zero personal Drive storage quota of its own: it can create
folders (metadata-only, no storage cost) but every real file upload fails
with a "Service Accounts do not have storage quota" 403 -- confirmed for
real, not just from docs. See build_drive_service() below and
GDRIVE_OAUTH_* in config.py for the one-time setup this requires.

Design mirrors existing conventions elsewhere in this codebase rather than
inventing new ones:
  - Change detection uses the same cheap (mtime, size) fingerprint idea as
    app.py's _file_fingerprint(), not a full-content hash on every run.
  - Backup file naming/pruning philosophy matches database.py's
    _backup_database_file() (timestamped, safe to call repeatedly).
  - Scheduling is a self-rescheduling threading.Timer, the same pattern as
    app.py's schedule_item_export().
  - "Not configured" is a clean no-op (log once, never raise, never
    schedule), the same fallback discipline as SYSTEM_ACCESS_TOKEN /
    ACCOUNTS_ACCESS_PASSWORD in config.py.

Manifest file (data/.cloud_backup_manifest.json) is the local source of
truth for what Drive is believed to hold: relative_path -> {drive_file_id,
size, mtime_ns, hash (optional, lazily filled)}. It is saved after every
single file operation succeeds, so an interrupted run never has to redo
work it already finished.

          a fresh/empty manifest pointed at an already-populated Drive
          folder (a new deployment reusing an existing backup folder).
          Without this, every one of those paths looks "new" to

          duplicates on Drive (one real run went from an expected 8,044
          files to 16,102).
      (b) the manifest references Drive file ids that no longer exist --
          the Drive folder was emptied, or files removed, by hand.
          Without this, classify_changes trusts the stale manifest
          entry's (size, mtime) and treats the file as unchanged forever,
          so a sync never notices anything is wrong; only a fresh
          verification listing caught it, after the fact, with nothing
          done to actually fix it.
