"""Minimal Tally-to-cloud feeder.

Runs on the office machine that can reach Tally. It does NOT start the
website (no Flask server, no waitress) and needs no mappings.db, no image
folder, and no login/admin routes. It only:

  1. pulls the car master, hierarchy and item stock from Tally, and
  2. pushes that data to the cloud site (CLOUD_SYNC_URL / CLOUD_SYNC_TOKEN).

The Tally fetching and the cloud push are the site's own, already-hardened
functions in app.py (self-healing retries, XML sanitizing, multiple-instance
detection); this file only decides WHEN to call them. Importing app.py starts
no threads and, with FEEDER_MODE=1 (set below), never touches the database.

Schedule (same as the full site): a full refresh (car master + hierarchy +
stock) on startup, then a stock export every TALLY_EXPORT_INTERVAL seconds
(180 by default). The site only runs a full refresh at startup or when an
admin clicks Full Refresh; nobody can click that here, so this also repeats it
every FEEDER_FULL_REFRESH_HOURS (default 6) so new cars/items reach the cloud.

New items: the stock export silently drops in-stock items that are not in the
hierarchy yet. When one shows up (a name that was not already unmatched after the
last refresh) the feeder runs a full refresh right away, at most once per
FEEDER_NEW_ITEM_MIN_MINUTES (default 10), doubling that gap (max 1 hour) after a
failed or slow refresh (FEEDER_SLOW_REFRESH_SECONDS, default 300; a normal one takes ~30 s). The shop can
also force one: a file called refresh_now.flag in this folder (double-click
refresh_feeder_now.bat) is noticed within a couple of seconds and removed after a
successful refresh. Every full refresh logs its reason (startup, timer, new item,
manual) and how long Tally took.

Every cycle is wrapped in try/except, so an unreachable Tally or a failed push
just logs and retries next cycle. Run it forever under Windows Task Scheduler
(see FEEDER_SETUP.md), which restarts it if the process ever dies.
